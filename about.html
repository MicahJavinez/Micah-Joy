Volleyball is one of the best methods to remain in shape, in addition to being a lot of fun. The top five health advantages of playing volleyball at our Smoky Mountain sports complex are as follows: <h3>

<h3> 1. Burns Fat and Calories
One of the best benefits of playing volleyball is that it helps to burn off calories. As a result, your body can effectively maintain a positive ratio between muscle and fat. It has been estimated that just a half hour game of competitive volleyball can burn anywhere from 120 to 178 calories, while a less competitive game may result in 90 to 133 calories burned off. Volleyball is a great way to maintain a healthy weight, which reduces the risks of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.<h3>
<h3> 2. Builds and Tones MusclesTeam of young men playing volleyball.
The physical motions used while playing volleyball help to build the muscles in your upper and lower body. You squat and use your legs for power when passing the ball, and use your hands, arms, and legs to set the ball. Since playing volleyball requires constant use of the arms and legs, you are effectively gaining the benefits of a full body workout! In addition to building strength and improving your respiratory and cardiovascular systems, you will receive the added benefit of toning your muscles. <h3>
<h3> 3. Improved Mental Health
When you play in a volleyball tournament at our Smoky Mountain sports complex and work together with your team to achieve a common goal, you will strengthen friendships and feel a sense of group cohesion. Team sports are also a fantastic way to improve your self confidence and reduce stress. The positive feelings you get from playing volleyball will transfer over to other areas of your life off the court as well!  <h3>
<h3> 4. Builds Coordination, Balance, and Speed
New volleyball players quickly improve their coordination, balance, and speed. The sport involves all of these important abilities, since the game play consists of serving, passing, setting, blocking, and much more. These essential skills are used constantly to be effective in volleyball games, so you will notice yourself developing these skills more with each match!<h3>
<h3> 5. Increased Aerobic Activity
While it may seem surprising, studies have shown that someone playing even a slow paced 20 minute game of volleyball can use the identical amount of energy as a person jogging for a mile. By playing a more intense game of volleyball, you use the same amount of energy in just 12 minutes as someone jogging a mile! Longer and more competitive games have even more tremendous health benefits. In addition to enhancing your energy level, your increased aerobic activity will improve your performance in a variety of other sports.

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<h3>Billiards is a tabletop game in which pool sticks (or cues) are used to drive hard balls into one of six pockets. It is a casual game noted for its pervasive presence in bars and pubs (hence the name pool hall). Casually, as an amateur, or even professionally, the game can be played. Each round of billiards, regardless of the game style, is presented differently and needs players to be mentally and physically nimble. <h3>

<h3>-Helps build focus –  Playing pool requires a great amount of focus and concentration. Your ability to focus on a given objective is essential in achieving happiness and attaining goals. In billiards, players must focus on their targets (the cue ball and the target ball), the angle of their own cue, the angle the cue ball will move in once it is hit and if the cue ball will strike the target ball.<h3>
<h3>- Burns calories – There is a surprising amount of beneficial walking involved in a round of pool: a typical 2-hour 8-ball or 9-ball session often provides 100 trips
around the table’s perimeter, which is about equal to walking nearly three-quarters of a mile. Playing multiple games of pool will stack up these distances and burn even more calories! <h3>
<h3>- Enables stretching and balance – Playing requires a lot more stretching than a person would not normally do. Having to bend across the table top to reach the cue ball at a desired angle requires a player to be moderately flexible, especially with complex shots. Pool also enhances balance as the game requires you to stand on one foot at certain time, promoting stability.<h3>
<h3>- Helps build control – Studies have shown that individuals who play cue sports like pool are less likely to panic amid crisis.The levelheadedness of those who play concentration games are able to think clearly and logically, enabling them examine the most pertinent facts and details and encourage them to go into action without becoming hysterical.<h3>
<h3>-Sharpens the mind – Those who frequently play billiards and pool often have sharper minds. Pool requires performing mental mathematical estimates and calculations, such as basic geometry and physics. These skills are necessary to calculate precise angles and trajectories and to determine how much force to apply during a strike so as not to under or overshoot a target. Having a sharp mind enables one to think on their feet faster and pick up on little details. <h3>
